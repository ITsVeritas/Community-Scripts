# Template Structure

This template directory includes the proper structure for submitting a new script. Your submission should include a new folder, with the scripts purpose, a script, and a read me file in markdown format.

## Supported Script Languages

|Extension|Language|
|---------|--------|
|.PS1|Powershell|
|.VBS|Visual Basic|
|.BAT|Batch|

### Note

As PowerShell is our primary language of choice you are strongly encouraged to use it over the other options. While supported, they may take longer to review.
