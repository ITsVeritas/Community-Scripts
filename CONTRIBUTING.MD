To expedite the process of releasing community content the Patch My PC team has created the following work flow to make it easier for everyone involved.

## Branches

Branches can get out of control quickly. To minimize sprawl, we require all branches to be created from master with the exception of the Patch My PC team. Additionally, we require the following naming standard to be followed. **Failure to follow this standard will cause your pull request to be immediatly declined**

- Branch Name must start with either NEW or EDIT
- Branch Name must end with the name of the folder being submitted.

### Example

- NEW-CreateTaskPreScript
- EDIT-CreateTaskPreScript

### Exceptions

The Patch My PC team may create alternate names for overall fixes, or changes to improve the repository.

## Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request you will be required to meet the pull request template. Additionally, the pull request will require approval from at least two members of the PMPC team to merged. This is to help ensure no one misses anythign and that nothing malicious is uploaded, intentionally or otherwise. When you create a pull request you will be provided with a template and a checklist to follow.

This checklist must be filled out and all changes wil require approval from two reviewers. Validate
